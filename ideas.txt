Also for you’re PL project... you should do something website oriented with Ruby on Rails
That’s a project where you can really build something your proud of. I’m trying to think what would be most your speed. A website around:
- environmental policies in this election cycle
- van life route given constraints (costs, time) (pull in reviews of the American west)
You want to build a project that your excited about
And because you’ll be collaborating, you definitely want to use GitHub!
